# SEP4 - IOT
## DESCRIPTION
Design and implement a FreeRTOS based application in C for an AVR2560 MCU that interfaces to several sensors and actuators

Use LoRaWAN (IoT-Network) for transmitting and receiving data. Drivers to sensors and actuators will be given.

Minimum requirements to the embedded software:
- You must use at least five tasks.
- Some data must be used by more than one task.
- You must use semaphores, mutexes and queues.

Your software must run on your Arduino Mega2560 board with VIA-shield and make use of the following sensors and actuators:
- Temperature/Humidity
- CO2
- LoRaWAN transceiver
- RC-servo
- Light (optional)
- Sound (optional)
- PIR sensor (optional)
